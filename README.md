## Season 2
The second season of the Spy × Family anime television series was produced by Wit Studio and CloverWorks. It was first announced alongside an animated theatrical film in December 2022, at Jump Festa. Ichirō Ōkouchi is replacing Furuhashi as scriptwriter, with the remaining staff and cast reprising their roles.[1][2][3] The series continues to follow master spy Twilight, under the alias of the psychiatrist Loid Forger, and his pretend family, consisting of his daughter Anya, a telepath, his wife Yor, an assassin known as the Thorn Princess, and the family dog Bond with precognitive power.

The second season of the anime series consists of 12 episodes. The titles of its episodes are written as "Mission" with a number (e.g. "Mission 1", "Mission 2", etc.) which the counting continues across seasons; the first episode of this season is "Mission 26". This kind of naming follows the original manga's practice, which also uses "Mission" for chapter titles.

The first episode premiered on October 7, 2023.[4][5] The opening theme is directed by Masaaki Yuasa and uses the song "Kura Kura" (クラクラ, lit. "Dizzy") performed by Ado. The ending theme is directed by Eugene Winter and uses the song "Todome no Ichigeki" (トドメの一撃, lit. "Finishing Strike") performed by Vaundy (feat. Cory Wong).[6][7][8][9][10][11]

The season is licensed for streaming by Crunchyroll outside of Asia,[12] while it is distributed by Muse Communication in a selection of countries in South and Southeast Asia.[a][13]
